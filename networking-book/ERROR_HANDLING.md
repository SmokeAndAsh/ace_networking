# Network Errors
`src/network_error.rs`

The network_error.rs file defines a NetworkError enum that encapsulates various kinds of errors that can occur within the Networking crate. This enum includes variants for client errors, connection issues, custom errors, gateway errors, HTTP status codes, IO errors, request errors, and serialization/deserialization errors.

Each variant of NetworkError is as follows:

    ClientError(ClientError): Represents errors originating from client-related operations.
    ConnectionError(String): For general connection-related errors with a human-readable message.
    CustomError(String): A generic error variant allowing custom error messages.
    GatewayError(GatewayError): Errors specifically associated with the gateway functionality.
    HttpError(StatusCode): Captures HTTP response status codes indicating issues like client or server errors.
    IoError(TokioIoError): IO-related errors, including reading and writing to networks using Tokio.
    RequestError(ReqwestError): Errors coming from the reqwest HTTP client when making requests.
    SerdeError(SerdeError): Serialization or deserialization errors from serde_json.

The file also contains a kind method which returns a string indicating the type of error for logging or display purposes.

This NetworkError enum acts as a bridge between the network layer and other parts of the application. It seems well-defined and able to capture a wide range of potential errors that can occur during network operations.

# Gateway Errors
`src/gateway/gateway_error.rs`

The gateway_error.rs file defines a GatewayError enum that represents errors specific to the gateway module, such as data processing and routing issues. The GatewayError enum includes the following variants:

    GatewayError(String): General errors that occur within the gateway module with a custom message.
    ClientError(String): Errors related to client operations within the gateway module.

The file also provides From trait implementations to convert GatewayError into ClientError and NetworkError, allowing errors to be propagated up through the error handling hierarchy:

    Converting a GatewayError to a ClientError transforms it into a SpecificError with a string representation of the original GatewayError.
    Converting a GatewayError to a NetworkError encapsulates the GatewayError directly within a NetworkError::GatewayError variant.

`GatewayError` is designed to handle lower-level errors that may be related to either gateway-specific issues or client-specific issues within the context of the gateway. The conversion implementations help to maintain the context of an error as it propagates to higher layers of the application, which is crucial for effective debugging and error handling.

# Client Errors
`src/gateway/clients/client_error.rs`

The client_error.rs file defines a ClientError enum to represent various errors that can occur at the client level across different services or APIs. It contains four variants:

    AuthenticationError(String): For issues related to failed authentication attempts.
    GenericError(String): A broad category for errors that don't fit into more specific ones.
    RateLimitError(String): When client operations are rate-limited by a service or API.
    SpecificError(String): For identifiable, specific client-related errors.

The file also includes From trait implementations to convert a ClientError into a GatewayError and a NetworkError, preserving the error context:

    A ClientError is transformed to GatewayError::ClientError, with appropriate formatting based on the specific ClientError variant on which the conversion is taking place.
    A ClientError is wrapped directly by NetworkError::ClientError without transformation. This method keeps the ClientError intact as it propagates up the network layer.

## Candle-Specific Errors
`src/gateway/clients/candle/candle_error.rs`

The candle_error.rs file defines the CandleError enum, which represents errors specific to interactions with the Candle API or errors that originate from the Candle client. The variants of CandleError include:

    CandleIoError(CoreError::Io): Input/output errors coming from the candle_core crate.
    CoreError(CoreError): General core errors from the candle_core crate.
    CudaError(CoreError::Cuda): CUDA-related errors, for GPU computation issues.
    DecodingError(TokenError), EncodingError(TokenError): Errors relating to the tokenization process.
    GenericError(ClientError): A generic error that envelops client-side errors.
    LoadModelError(CoreError), SafeTensorError(CoreError::SafeTensor), WrappedCandleError(CoreError::Wrapped): Specific errors for model operations, safe tensor issues, and wrapped errors.
    UnexpectedDTypeError(CoreError::UnexpectedDType), UnsupportedDTypeError(DType), UnexpectedError(CoreError): Issues related to data types and unexpected situations.
    UninitializedModelError(CoreError::Wrapped): Errors due to using models that haven't been initialized.

The file also contains several From trait implementations to convert between CandleError, ClientError, CoreError, and TokenError, which provides a clear pathway for error transformation as follows:

    From<CandleError> for ClientError: Converts CandleError variants to ClientError::SpecificError or ClientError::GenericError, retaining the original message with additional context.
    From<CoreError> for CandleError, From<TokenError> for CandleError: These conversions ensure that errors from the candle_core and tokenizers crates are wrapped appropriately inside CandleError variants.
    From<Box<dyn StdError>> for CandleError: Handles casting boxed standard errors to specific CandleError variants using downcasting or, if the exact type is unknown, wrapping the error as a string inside the WrappedCandleError variant.
